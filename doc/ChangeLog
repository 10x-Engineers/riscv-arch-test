	This is the first version of the document taken from Simon
	Davidmann's MS Word document. The main document is design.adoc,
	legacy material, currently just appendices C and D has been moved
	to legacy.adoc.

	design.adoc is correct AsciiDoc.  legacy.adoc is just a raw dump,
	which needs cleaning up.

	The next step will be restructuring design.adoc as agreed.

	* .gitignore: Created.
	* ChangeLog: Created.
	* Makefile: Created.
	* design.adoc: Created.
	* legacy.adoc: Created.
